EA_board_FreeRTOS
=================

Different FreeRTOS projects using the Embedded Artsists Baseboard and LPC1769Xpresso 

The current plan is to expand the FreeRTOS + IO framework so that more devices and buses are supported. (starting with the
CAN bus)

Also, a new transfer mode to be added which will allow for easy reception and transmission of frame based formats as
compared to character based formats.
